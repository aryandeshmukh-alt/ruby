1. Why do we use inheritance?

Inheritance is used to reuse common functionality and reduce duplication in code. 
When multiple classes share similar behavior, a parent class can define that behavior once, and child classes can inherit it. 
This also makes the code easier to maintain because changes in shared logic need to be done in only one place.

Example, 
if there is an Employee class with common attributes like name and salary, a Developer or Manager class can inherit from it instead of rewriting the same logic.

class Employee
  def work
    puts "Employee is working"
  end
end

class Developer < Employee
end

dev = Developer.new
dev.work

In real life, 
this is similar to how a “Vehicle” can be a general category, and “Car” or “Bike” inherit common properties like speed and fuel type while still having their own specific features.



2. Why can’t we create objects from modules?

Modules are designed to share behavior, not to represent objects. 
They do not model real-world entities and are mainly used to group related methods that can be reused across multiple classes. 
Since modules are not meant to hold independent state like objects do, Ruby does not allow creating instances of modules.

Example, 
a module can be used to provide logging functionality to many classes.

module LoggerModule
  def log(message)
    puts "[LOG] #{message}"
  end
end

In real life, 
this is similar to a rulebook or instruction manual. You don’t create an object from a rulebook, but many people or systems can follow the same rules.



3. What is the difference between include and extend?

The include keyword is used when you want the methods of a module to become instance methods of a class. 
This means every object of that class can use those methods. 
The extend keyword is used when you want the module’s methods to be available at the class level, not on individual objects.

Example,
using include

class User
  include LoggerModule
end

user = User.new
user.log("User created")

Example,
using extend

class User
  extend LoggerModule
end

User.log("Class-level log")

In real life, 
include is like giving every employee a handbook to use personally, while 
extend is like giving management a shared rule that applies to the whole organization.



4. When should we use a module instead of a class?

A module should be used when the goal is to share common behavior across different classes without creating an inheritance relationship. 
Modules are useful when multiple unrelated classes need the same functionality, such as logging, authentication helpers, or utility methods.

Example, 
both an Employee class and an Admin class might need logging, but they are not logically related through inheritance.

class Employee
  include LoggerModule
end

class Admin
  include LoggerModule
end

In real life, 
this is similar to using the same tool, such as email or a calculator, in different professions. 
The tool is shared, but it does not define what the person is.
